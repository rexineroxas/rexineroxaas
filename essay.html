				As a Filipino citizen, it saddens me how the Philippines went from being a 
				mighty country to a country that is filled with feud amongst its people.
				We argue amongst each other, steal from each other, kill each other.
				We do all of this for what? To feed our families? For our selfish needs?
				<br><br>
				Humans are selfish. It is in our nature, and is present in the overwhelming amount of drugs being smuggled inside our very walls, in the amount of money stolen from the government by the pigs in positions of power, 
				and in the amount of resources they hoard for themselves.
				<div class="quote1">
				If we cannot eradicate the source, then we have to weed out those consumed by it.
				</div>
			</div>

		<div class="box2">
				<div class="text2">
				In his 5th State of the Nation Address last July 27, our beloved President Rodrigo Duterte urged the Congress to reinstate the death penalty for the violators of the country’s anti-drugs law. As we all know, Duterte,
				at the start of his term, declared his war on drugs and told us Filipino citizens that he’ll get it done within six months. Four years many deaths later, he unfortunately still hasn’t gotten his goal. It’s understandable,
				since like I said, convicting people suffering from addiction is no easy feat., hence why Duterte is urging Congress to revive the death penalty. My question is, why stop at drug crimes?
				<br><br>
				Despite the beauty of the Philippines, we have a rather high crime rate. We’re ranked 71 on the countries worldwide with the highest crime rates, 
				and ranked 18 among the Asian countries. This reflects how badly we need a change of systems. 
				<br><br>
				Changing the entire system as we know it sounds complex and impossible to do at first. I shall now suggest a 
				simple solution to this problem.

				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="box3">
			
			<div class="text3">
				Like I said earlier, Duterte’s idea of instituting the lethal injection as penalty for the violators 
				of the anti-drug laws isn’t unreasonable. The prison system does not work. There are severe cases of
				overpopulation, corruption, and deaths of inmates. The justice system is also flawed, since people in 
				power can easily avoid the punishments because of bias. I agree with the President. We are too gentle
				with our approach to this country’s problems. 
				<div class="quote2">
				I suggest that instead of only giving the lethal injection to those who violated the anti-drug laws, 
				we also give them to those who commit other crimes. 
				</div>
			</div>

		<div class="box4">
				<div class="text4">
				Anyone legal of age is eligible for this punishment, 
				as I believe that anyone under the age of eighteen can still be corrected. 
				<div class="quote3">
				A question of yours might be, “What about the people who have no choice? Those who commit crimes to bring food to the table? 
				Who gets to decide who dies?” I shall answer these in the following parts:
				</div>
				This year’s budget for the Armed Forces of the Philippines is P192 Billion, and P187.6 Billion for the Philippine National Police. Furthermore, the price of criminal justice and jail maintenance is well above P165 billion. My idea of sentencing criminals to the lethal injection will drastically decrease the need for prison maintenance and police. We could instead allocate the funds to the education and sponsorship of the people in need of financial assistance. Additionally, we could renovate the former prison houses to make them habitable so that those without homes have somewhere to go. 
				<br><br>
				A lot of corrupt policemen and politicians will definitely be affected by the new policy, so we don’t need to worry about the unemployment rates if there aren’t any people that are going to be unemployed. Furthermore, if all the corrupt people in the government can sentenced, it will free up a lot of stolen money that we can use for the people’s welfare. 
				<br><br>
				As for who decides who to sentence, I suggest we put the responsibility to the former people in need of assistance. They will be given education, so we need not worry about them not knowing how to run things. In addition, people are less likely to be biased because if we gave people the financial support that they need, then there will be no need for taking bribes. 
				<br><br>
				Another point of mine is that instituting the lethal injection as a punishment will discourage anyone from committing crimes in the future. A win-win for all.
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="box5">
			<img src="prison.jpg" alt="image 3">
			<div class="text5">
				Our system is flawed. Being gentle and forgiving is not going to solve our country’s problems. If we do not start the change that we need, then we’ll still be holding the fragments of a destroyed society in years to come. I only think of the benefit of my country as I am writing this, and not of personal gain. I can only hope that the people are willing to listen, and willing to accept change.
